My father's church's website is woefully out of date.  For practice, I rebuilt it entirely for them.  Currently waiting to see if they like my work and want to use it.  In the mean time, I'm still going to show it off here.

My site: [https://covenantofgrace.netlify.app](https://covenantofgrace.netlify.app "Covenant of Grace")
